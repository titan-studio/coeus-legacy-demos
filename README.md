# Coeus Demos
This is a planned repository to contain a collection of demos for [Coeus](https://github.com/titan-studio/coeus), our game engine. The demos here will rely on whatever the latest version of Coeus is unless they say otherwise.

There isn't much here yet, but you can check out `messy.lua` for a (messy) sample application. It relies on some assets that are in this [this release](https://github.com/titan-studio/coeus-demos/releases/tag/v0.1-alpha) as well as a full installation of [Coeus v0.1-alpha](https://github.com/titan-studio/coeus/releases/tag/v0.1-alpha).
